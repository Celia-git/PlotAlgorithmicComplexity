# Comparative Analysis of Time Complexity of Various Sorting and Search Algorithms

- This program uses matplot library to display the differing runtime complexities of various sorting and search algorithms on large files, implemented in Python.
- **Assignment1:** Binary vs Linear Search 
- **Assignment2:** Bubble vs Selection Sort  
- **Assignment3:** Linear Insertion Sort vs Binary Recursive Insertion Sort vs Doubly Linked List Insertion Sort
- **Assignment4:** Merge Sort vs Quick Sort *Lomuto* vs Quick Sort *Hoare*
- **Assignment5:** Depth First Recursive Search vs Depth First Stack Search vs Breadth First Search
